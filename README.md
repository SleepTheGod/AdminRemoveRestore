This Bash script is designed to manage user privileges on a Linux system by adding or removing users from the sudo group, which grants administrative permissions. It starts by displaying a message from the script's author and then prompts the user to choose one of two options: add all system users to the sudo group or remove them. Based on the userâ€™s choice, the script checks each account listed in the /etc/passwd file. If the choice is "1," it iterates through each user, checks if they are already in the sudo group, and adds them if they are not. If the choice is "2," the script similarly checks each user, removing them from the sudo group if they are members. If an invalid option is entered, it prompts the user to try again. This approach automates privilege escalation and de-escalation for multiple accounts, but should be used carefully, as it affects all users indiscriminately.
